## Introduction

This project is an automated reports template using publicly accessible data related to the salaries of professors at Arizona State University. The Rmd documents utilize functions to extract data and create a table and graph for comparing professor salaries. This is further extrapolated by using loops to break down salaries by teaching department (i.e., Psychology, Sociology, Mathematics, etc.).

## Purpose

To learn how to utilize loops and functions for automated reporting tasks. This is useful for delivering the results of a data project to stakeholders and providing a clean and presentable report focusing on top-level information.
